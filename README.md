Wordpress Maps Plugin

Made to test Mapbox API. Work in progress.

Just install in wordpress as a regular plugin. It will create a db table on activation to store settings. And a submenu in the wordpress dashboard. Go to settings, enter your API key(s) and then use wither "mumbles_mapbox_map" or "mumbles_google_map" shortcode on any page. Woocommerce integration still not implemented.
